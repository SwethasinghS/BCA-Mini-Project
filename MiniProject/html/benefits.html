                            <p>
It is very essential to take a personal loan for all. Whether it can be from a Bank or form a Private Bank.
It is very easy to apply and take out a loan. There will be no collateral or any guarantee for applying for a loan.
If a client is eligible, within a day he/she can get a Loan.

Personal Loan can be taken for any purpose like Education Loan,Business Loan, Marriage, To buy any Product, etc.
The Loan will be having less repayment(12 to 60)months. Minimal documents required 
<dl>
   <dt><h4><b>Short-term repayment tenors</b></h4></dt>
       <dd><p>One of the personal loan benefits is the repayment tenor that ranges up to 60 months. 
          you also get the freedom to choose a period depending on your needs.</p></dd>
    <dt><h4><b>Flexibility and Versatility</b></h4></dt> 
       <dd><p>Some types of loans can only be used for a certain purpose. For example, if you take out a car loan, the only way to use the funds is to purchase a vehicle. Personal loans can be used for many purposes, from consolidating debt to paying off medical bills.
        If you want to finance a major purchase but don’t want to be locked into how you use the money, a personal loan can be a good alternative. Check with your lender on the approved uses for the loan before applying.</p></dd>       
    <dt><h4><b>Easier to manage</b></h4></dt>    
       <dd><p>One reason some people take out personal loans is to consolidate debt, such as multiple credit card accounts. A personal loan with a single, fixed-rate monthly payment is easier to manage than several credit cards with different interest rates, payment due dates and other variables.
        Borrowers who qualify for a personal loan with a lower interest rate than their credit cards can streamline their monthly payments and save money in the process.</p></dd>
    <dt><h4><b>No collateral requirement</b></h4></dt>    
       <dd><p>Unsecured personal loans don’t require collateral for you to get approved. This means you don’t have to put your car, home or other asset up as a guarantee that you’ll repay the funds. If you’re unable to repay the loan based on the agreed-upon terms with your lender, you’ll face significant financial consequences. However, you don’t have to worry about losing a home or a car as a direct result.</p></dd>
    <dt><h4><b>Builds Credit Score</b></h4></dt>
       <dd><p>If you have a low credit score or are new to credit, a great way to build your score is by availing affordable personal loans and repaying them on time. As you pay your EMIs on time along with the pre-decided interest rate, your credit score will increase.
        However, it is important to avail a loan amount that is within your repayment ability. If not, missing EMI payments can be detrimental to your credit score.</p></dd>
